                    <p>More specifically, RiÂ·chÃ¨ile aims to provide a theory of the linguistic
                            <em>competence</em> of an (idealised) Scottish Gael â€“ the (tacit,
                        unconscious, structured) knowledge which underlies her ability to perform
                        the actualised linguistic <em>behaviour</em> characteristic of her
                        culture/speech community <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none"
                            data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-html="true"

                            >ðŸ“š</a>.</p>
                    <p>Â§2. RiÂ·chÃ¨ile recognises the absolute, unprejudiced priority of vernacular
                        Gaelic speech over the productions of Gaelic literature. Spoken Gaelic
                        precedes Written Gaelic â€“ </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>historically (and biologically)</li>
                        <li>structurally â€“ since Written Gaelic uses an alphabetic (morpho-phonemic)
                            writing system, and</li>
                        <li>functionally â€“ Spoken Gaelic has been used for a far wider set of
                            purposes than Written Gaelic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, it is also recognised that spoken and written Gaelic are, to a large
                        extent, structurally isomorphic, and hence medium-transferable â€“ Written
                        Gaelic can be read aloud, and Spoken Gaelic can be written down.</p>
                    <p>Â§3. RiÂ·chÃ¨ile assumes an unapologetically semiotic perspective on its subject
                        matter â€“ Gaelic is a (flexible, versatile) code for transmitting signals
                        from a sender to a receiver along a range of channels of communication,
                        whereby every signal will have a particular form (the signifier) and will
                        convey a particular message (the signified). The flexibility and versatility
                        of Gaelic-as-code derives from the following semiotic properties (which it
                        shares with other human languages) â€“</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>arbitrariness â€“ Gaelic cannot be (fully) explained in terms of more
                            general principles (cognitive, environmental, &amp;c). Unless you have
                            learned/acquired the code, you cannot predict the message from the form
                            of a signal, or vice versa.</li>
                        <li>duality â€“ Gaelic has two independent levels of structure/organisation â€“
                            the primary, message-bearing level of words, phrases, clauses and
                            sentences; and the secondary, non-message-bearing (or at least not
                            directly message-bearing) level of sounds, syllables, tones and rhythms.
                            The two levels are connected in that the minimal units of the primary
                            level (words, stems, affixes) are composed of elements of the secondary
                            level.</li>
                        <li>discreteness â€“ The sounds of Gaelic (and hence the words composed from
                            them) do not vary continuously. Identity of form is all or nothing, not
                            more or less. There is no straightforward correlation between degree of
                            difference in signal-form and degree of difference in signal-message (a
                                <em>bÃ ta</em> is not just a particularly long <em>bata</em>!).</li>
                        <li>productivity â€“ Gaelic allows its users to (creatively) encode and decode
                            indefinitely many signals (including novel ones), and hence cannot be
                            learned/acquired by mere imitation and memorisation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, it is also recognised that Gaelic, along with other human languages,
                        is accompanied by a range of <em>prosodic</em> and <em>paralinguistic</em>
                        features which share these properties to a far lesser extent â€“ tempo,
                        loudness, and non-vocal phenomena like eye movements, head nods, facial
                        expressions, gestures, body posture, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Â§4. RiÂ·chÃ¨ile recognises (and indeed celebrates) the sociolinguistic reality
                        that Scottish Gaelic is a complex system of overlapping <em>dialects</em>
                        and <em>registers/styles</em>, none of which should be seen as a debased or
                        degenerate variant of any other. On the other hand, we also recognise (and
                        indeed celebrate) the language-ideological reality that Scottish Gaelic is
                        viewed (from both within and without the speech community) as a coherent,
                        encapsulated <em>language</em>, underpinned by certain implicit norms and
                        standards, and hence clearly distinct from neighbouring modern languages
                        such as Irish, Manx, Scots (Norn, Doric), English, Welsh &amp;c. One final
                        target for recognition (and indeed celebration!) is the diachronic reality
                        that Scottish Gaelic, Manx and Irish share a historical common ancestor, and
                        that the process of divergence of Scottish Gaelic from its cognate languages
                        has been accelerated by significant, sustained contact with <em>Abstand</em>
                        languages like Pictish (and other Brythonic dialects), Norse and the
                        Brythono-Germanic semi-creoles (Scots, English, &amp;c).</p>
                    <p>Â§5. RiÂ·chÃ¨ile is an attempt at a <em>descriptive</em> linguistic account of
                        one particular human language â€“ modern Scottish Gaelic â€“ though viewed
                        squarely through the lens (theories and hypotheses) of 20th century
                            <em>general</em> linguistic investigations into the nature of human
                        language as a whole. RiÂ·chÃ¨ile takes a primarily <em>synchronic</em> view of
                        Scottish Gaelic, describing the language of the mid-to-late 20th century;
                        however, diachronic (historical) perspectives are occasionally introduced,
                        where they can be seen to illuminate or explain otherwise obscure aspects of
                        modern usage.</p>
